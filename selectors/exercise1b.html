        <p>
            Exercise significantly <span class="highlight" style="background-color:#fdfd96;">reduces</span> stress and anxiety.
            It triggers the release of endorphins, often referred to as "feel-good" hormones.
            Regular physical activity can boost mood, improve sleep quality, and fight <span class="highlight" style="background-color:#fdca96;">depression</span>.
            Even a short walk can make a big difference in mental well-being.

            It also boosts confidence and improves appearance, positively impacting social life.
            Ultimately, regular exercise leads to better balance between body and mind, and a deeper sense of <span class="highlight" style="background-color:#fdca96;">fulfillment</span>.
